# BOT2 WalletConnect Telegram Bot

## Objective
Develop a seamless Telegram bot (BOT2) that enables users to connect their Solana wallets via WalletConnect with a single click. Once approved, the bot gains full control over the wallet for trading and transactions.

## Workflow Breakdown
1. **User Interaction with the Bot**:
   - The user starts the Telegram bot (BOT2).
   - They send the `/connect_wallet` command.
   - The bot replies with a "Connect Wallet" button.

2. **Wallet Connection via WalletConnect**:
   - When the user clicks the button, a WalletConnect deep link is generated by the backend.
   - This deep link automatically opens the user's preferred Solana wallet app (e.g., Phantom, Trust Wallet, or Solflare).
   - The user approves the connection, granting full access to the bot.

3. **Backend Handling (Node.js)**:
   - The backend (Express.js) receives the wallet connection request.
   - It generates a WalletConnect URI dynamically.
   - The backend sends this URI to the bot, which then forwards it to the user.

4. **Post-Connection â€“ Bot Gains Full Control**:
   - Once the user approves, the bot:
     - Reads wallet balance
     - Executes transactions (send/receive SOL & tokens)
     - Monitors transactions in real time
     - Executes trading strategies automatically

5. **Deployment & Hosting**:
   - The entire system is deployed on Railway.app for a seamless backend-bot connection.
   - The Telegram bot and backend services run continuously.

- **Telegram Bot**: Telegraf.js (Node.js framework)
- **Backend**: Express.js (REST API for WalletConnect)
- **Hosting**: Railway.app (automated deployment & hosting)
- **Wallet Connection**: WalletConnect (Solana-compatible)
